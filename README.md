# The Forbidden Hitchhiker's Guide to the Cataclysm: The Last Generation

<img src="src/assets/dont_panic.png" width=300 align="right" />

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Cataclysm is a guide to the zombie survival roguelike game [Cataclysm: The Last Generation](https://github.com/Cataclysm-TLG/Cataclysm-TLG). You can search for things in the game, like items, or monsters, and find useful information about them. The data in the Guide comes directly from the JSON files in the game itself.

The Guide stores all its data locally and is offline-capable, so you can take it with you wherever you go. There's nothing to do to make the Guide work offline, just visit the page and it will work even without internet access, as long as you've visited it once before. It's also installable, so you can pop it out of your browser and use it like a regular app.

_More popular than the Celestial Home Care Omnibus, better selling than Fifty-three More Things to do in Zero Gravity, and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid's trilogy of philosophical blockbusters Where God Went Wrong, Some More of God's Greatest Mistakes and Who is this God Person Anyway?_

> @Goodgulf_PL Thanks for letting me know. Please take that down or I'll have to brick it on my end.  
> That will be annoying to do, so.

> ok, I really doesn't understand why but ok, I will take this Hitchhiker site down, but it was fun to build it.

> worm girl â€” 8:05 AM  
> Thank you, I really do appreciate you being cool about it. It is not something I want to have for TLG for reasons I've gone over here in the chat many times, and I am sorry if you're only hearing this after doing the work.

> Big thing is cus the hope is people make a WIKI instead.  
> WIth like... written discriptions of the creatures and guides and stuff like that  
> instead of just all the stats

> It also just turns people into zombies where they stare at the loot tables instead of playing the game. It's the same reason I removed autonotes.  
> It has had a noticable impact on how DDA folks play and engage with that game and IMO it hasn't been a good one.

> kat â€” 8:07 AM  
> its also not really necessary for TLG since a lot of the pointlessly labyrinthian features of DDA have been removed or streamlined

> worm girl â€” 8:08 AM  
> And it gives people false confidence about things. You'll see like a 1% drop rate on an item for a location but actually it's only populating there for some obscure reason and you'd never actually see it in the game  
> Or you look at a monster entry and it seems like it's not all that difficult because HHG has no way to explain how its unique powers work
>
> worm girl â€” 8:09 AM  
> But mostly it's because watching people look at HHG, then tab over to their game, filter the overmap, autotravel to whatever autonote had the thing they wanted, let their car turret kill all the monsters, zone sort all the loot sight unseen into their deathmobile
